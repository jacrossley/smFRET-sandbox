# smFRET Diffusion Sandbox
## Overview
This simulation models particles diffusing through a confocal volume and stochastically switching between two conformational states with distinct FRET efficiencies. Each state yields different donor and acceptor emission rates, which are plotted in real time at the bottom of the page. As you watch individual particles change shape (circle ⇄ square), you can directly correlate those conformational switches with jumps in the green (donor) and orange (acceptor) count‑rate traces, just as you would observe in diffusion‑based single‑molecule FRET experiments. In real experiments, watching proteins in solution undergo these conformational transitions allows researchers to probe their dynamics and understand how these shape changes relate to biological function.
